<tr><td><b>November 28, 2009:</b> The first ever Saturday Night Shock premiered with a big bang!  We saw the ICW début of a second generation superstar, a triple threat match that was all action from bell to bell, and a main event that saw "The Legend By Design," John Patrick, take on the man from the Land of the Rising Sun, Shinya Okubo.  All of this, plus a huge birthday bash for ICW co-founder LJ Black! <a href="sns112809.html" target="new">Click here to read the results!</a>
