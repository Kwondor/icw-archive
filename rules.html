<tr><td>1. Intercontinental Championship Wrestling is meant for ORIGINAL wrestlers only. No superstars from the WWE, WCW, ECW or independent federations will be accepted. However, a wrestler's image may be used for your wrestler's pic base. Please check the taken pic bases page to see which wrestlers and other celebrities are being used. This is to avoid confusion and conflicts later on.
<p>
2. Wrestlers should be realistic. Therefore, there is a size limit of 7'5" height and 500 pounds for weight.
<p>
3. In keeping with realism, please no killing sprees in roleplays. People can't have their characters just go around killing people.
<p>
4. Sex and some violence in roleplays IS allowed, so long as it's not totally pointless - and comes with a warning label. We may have some youngins in the ranks.
<p>
5. You should post a sample roleplay in the general roleplay section of the forums after you are accepted so the roster can get a feel for your character since they do not see your application.
<p>
6. Complaining about losses while understandable will only be tolerated to a degree. Excessive bitching and moaning about a loss will not be tolerated. If you feel you did not deserve to lose a match, come to management and discuss it and we will be glad to go back over everything as long as it does not become a weekly habit. If so you may find your contract terminated.
<p>
7. It's not cool and considered bad form to take a real-life OOC situation and use it against your opponent in a roleplay. We're all creative people here, otherwise we wouldn't be doing this, so get your creative juices flowing.
<p>
8. Finally, please note that we reserve the right to reject any application.

<center><b><u>ROLEPLAY GRADING</u></b></center>
<p>
<i>Relevancy 50% of total grade. Given a rank from 1-20.</i><br>
Everyone should have relevancy in their roleplays. This is the most simple part; Did you talk about your match and/or storyline? Did you advance your character in anyway? That's all there is to it. Simple, right?
<p>
<i>Enjoyment/Look 50% of total grade. Given a rank from 1-20.<i><br>
Is your roleplay enjoyable? Did it tell a good story? The more we enjoy your roleplay the higher you score. Good grammar and spelling are a must. If there are a lot of misspelled words, we will not know what you are talking about and it will lower your score. The look also helps. Using websites for you roleplays or having pictures in them is always a good thing but not required. The role play itself is what is our main concern is.
<p>
There is a limit of three roleplays per show. Any roleplays placed on the boards after your third roleplay will not be counted towards your grade. If you fail to put up at least one roleplay for your match, you automatically lose.
<p>
The most important rule of all though is the most simple. Have fun and make friends. That's what we are all here for anyway.
