<font color="red">Backstage, one hour before showtime, Shirlea Frost can be found confronting Johnny Sorrow over ICW's drug testing policy.<br>
<br>
Shirlea: Come on, Johnny. Can't you reschedule my drug test? My father is really sick and I have to leave for Texas as soon as the show is over.<br>
<br>
Johnny: I'm sorry to hear about your father, Shirlea, but the fact remains that you have to be tested. I can assure you that it will take less than an hour.<br>
<br>
Shirlea trails her fingertip up Johnny's chest to his chin as she gives him a seductive smile.<br>
<br>
Shirlea: I can make it worth your while, Johnny.<br>
<br>
Johnny: Besides the fact that I’m old enough to be your father, I’m also very happily married. Now if you will excuse me, I have to prepare for the show.<br>
<br>
As Johnny walks off, Shirlea stomps her foot in anger.<br>
<br>
Shirlea: You old bastard! You couldn’t handle me even with a truckload of Viagra.<br>
<br>
A laugh can be heard as Bruce Vain walks up behind Shirlea.<br>
<br>
Bruce: Don't tell me. You're worried about a little thing like a drug test?<br>
<br>
Shirlea: Why don't you fuck off?<br>
<br>
Bruce: Is that an invitation?<br>
<br>
Voice: I don't think the lady wants any part of you.<br>
<br>
Bruce: I don't care what you think.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Scotty Paine slams Bruce into the wall and rears back his fist.<br>
<br>
Bruce: Not the face! Not the face!<br>
<br>
Scotty laughs as he releases Bruce, who scurries away like a scolded dog.<br>
<br>
Scotty: Well, I think that deserves a reward. What do to think, baby?<br>
<br>
Shirlea slaps Scotty across the face and turns, walking away in a huff. Scotty raises his hand to the red spot on his face and smiles.<br>
<br>
Scotty: She’s feisty. I like it.<br>
<br>
At that moment, Jonathan Black walks up and stands face to face with Scotty.<br>
<br>
John: Stay away from her, Paine.<br>
<br>
Scotty: Or what?<br>
<br>
John: If you value your job, don't cross me.<br>
<br>
The two men stand there silently staring one another down until Scotty turns and walks away laughing loudly.<br></font>

<font color="blue">[Amanda Fines is in front of the ICW logo and standing next to her is John Patrick.]<br>
<br>
Fines: Yes, that's right. I am standing here with the Legend by Design himself, John Patrick. John, tonight you take on Shinya Okubo in a return match from two weeks ago on Shock. How have you prepared for this match?<br>
<br>
Patrick: I have trained and worked real hard to get things going in a forward motion here, Amanda.<br>
<br>
Fines: Awesome. Now, last time on Shock Annabelle Jones made some real big statements and mentioned you by name. Check it out on the monitor.<br>
<br>
[We see Annabelle speaking from the last Shock.]<br>
<br>
Annabelle: The name Jones is famous in this business but you will someday look back on this day and remember it as the day that a new era of Jones wrestling was ushered in, the era of The Vindicator, the era of Annabelle Jones.<br>
<br>
It doesn’t matter who you are, from John Patrick all the way down to my wet behind the ears opponent tonight, not one of you will be able to stop my momentum.<br>
<br>
[Back to Amanda and John.]<br>
<br>
Fines: What do you have to say in response?<br>
<br>
Patrick: I know Annabelle fairly well, considering her step-dad is my best friend. Annabelle has a lot of pent up anger, apparently and that is all well and good. But she is just a youngling in this business. A business I have been in for 14 years now and don't see any signs of leaving anytime soon. If she wants to back up her talk. then she needs to meet me in the finals of the Shock tournament and she will find out that I am so much better than her. Now Amanda, if you will excuse me, I have a match to go win.<br>
<br>
[John walks off, leaving Amanda standing there.]<br></font>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<font color="blue">The red and white pyro explodes as the opening music plays. We scan across the arena packed with cheering fans with signs such as "Annabelle Jones Future Champion," "Wanted Dead or Alive Alex Morgan," and "The Case Sisters’ #1 Fan".<br>
<br>
Summer: Welcome to Saturday Night Shock. We are just over two weeks away from Eve of Destruction, which leaves the question: Who will find momentum going into the Shock Title Tournament?<br>
<br>
Johnny: That is a good question, Summer. Tonight we will see both of the Case sisters in action as well as a rematch between John Patrick and Shinya Okubo.<br>
<br>
Summer: Also we will see the débuts of Samuel Hessingstock and Scotty Paine as they go one on one. And in our main event, Annabelle Jones takes on "Outlaw" Alex Morgan.<br>
<br>
Johnny: For now, let’s send it down to...what the hell?<br>
<br>
The lights begin to flicker in the arena. Suddenly, "Down and Out" by Tantric hits the PA system!<br>
<br>
"The Harbinger of Doom" Kyle Sanders steps out onto the ramp. He looks rather pissed off. He stalks towards the ring, circles around and snatches a microphone from the ring announcer. He makes a backhanded slapping gesture to him and then slides into the ring. He makes a cutthroat gesture and the music dies. He looks out into the crowd and narrowly glares at each person. He slowly raises the mic up to his lips. The crowd is roaring with boos.<br>
<br>
Kyle: You people are pathetic! You don't recognize true greatness when it stands in the ring right under your noses! You think I give a damn what you think of me? Do you honestly think that I care that you are booing me?<br>
<br>
The boos grow even louder as Sanders addresses the crowd.<br>
<br>
Kyle: This company is doomed to fail because it doesn't recognize talent! The deal has been inked and I have yet to be booked on the show! I am the only talent on this roster! Nobody cares about that sick bastard, Scotty Paine! Nobody cares about that little BITCH, Annabelle Jones! We don't care that your mother is a whore! We don't! Hell, we don't even care about Alex Morgan! I am the future of ICW! ME! Not anyone else! I am where the smart money is; yet they overlook someone of my skills and book a two-bit reject like Scotty Paine! This is pathetic! I am Kyle Sanders! I was a 3rd round draft pick to the St. Louis Rams! I was an All-American! I am the best thing to ever grace the sport of professional wrestling; yet I was intentionally overlooked and passed over for a bunch of ingrates! I will rip apart this roster and I will stand in my rightful place as WORLD CHAMPION! I will destroy anyone who stands in my way to get there! I am THE HARBINGER OF DOOM! I AM KYLE SANDERS AND I DEMAND THAT YOU SHOW ME THE RESPECT THAT I DESERVE AND THE RESPECT THAT I DEMAND! I WANT ANSWERS AND I WANT THEM NOW! I WILL STAND IN THIS VERY RING UNTIL SOMEONE COMES OUT HERE AND GIVES ME THE ANSWERS I DEMAND!<br>
<br>
"Demons" by Tech N9ne plays as ICW co-owner LJ Black steps out on stage with a microphone in hand and serious look of anger on his face.<br>
<br>
Kyle: It's about time someone paid me the respect I deserve now...<br>
<br>
LJ: SHUT UP! Who the hell do you think you are threatening to hijack my show?<br>
<br>
Kyle: I'm "The Harbinger of Doom," Kyle Sanders, and I demand to know why I was not booked on this show!<br>
<br>
LJ: Let's make one thing clear, Mr. Sanders. No one makes demands of LJ Black. But since it is the holiday season and I am feeling generous, I will answer your question. This card was already booked when you signed your contract. Thus, it was too late to give you a match on the card. You will, however, be given the same shot at the Shock title as every other member of the roster at Eve of Destruction.<br>
<br>
Kyle: That's not good enough! I should not have to fight for a lower title! You should come to this ring and hand me the ICW World Title this instant!<br>
<br>
LJ: That is not how it works in ICW, Mr. Sanders. You want respect? You want championship gold? You earn it. Now, I suggest you get out of my ring.<br>
<br>
Kyle: You want me out of this ring, Black? Come remove me. But I promise I will beat you from turnbuckle to turnbuckle. You know, better yet, I'll come to you.<br>
<br>
Just as Kyle starts towards the ropes to exit the ring, Alexander Pendragon steps out onto the stage next to LJ with his arms crossed over his chest<br>
<br>
LJ: I don't think you've been introduced. Mr. Sanders, this is Alexander Pendragon, head of ICW security and my personal bodyguard. You see, Mr. Sanders, Alexander takes his job very seriously. So when I am threatened with bodily harm, he does not take such threats lightly. Alexander, please have your men remove this piece of trash from my arena.<br>
<br>
Alexander motions to the back and six security guards armed with stun batons make their way down to the ring to surround it completely. Slowly, Kyle exits the ring as security surrounds him. The guards lead him up the ramp where he stops atop the stage and glares daggers at LJ before he is escorted to the back.<br>
<br>
Summer: I can't believe what we just witnessed. Kyle Sanders has some nerve to threaten LJ Black like that.<br>
<br>
Johnny: The kid has a pair of brass balls. I'll give him that.<br>
<br>
Summer: If I'm correct, you signed Kyle Sanders to his ICW contract, Johnny?<br>
<br>
Johnny: That is correct, Summer, and trust me. The kid has talent. I just get the feeling though his ego may be writing checks his body can't cash, especially considering he made no friends back in the locker room after his statements tonight.<br>
<br>
Summer: Well, now that things have cleared up, let's send it to Jimmy Landell, Jr. at ringside for our first match.<br>
<br></font>
*****<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: Ladies and gentlemen. Our opening contest of the evening is a return match and it is scheduled for one fall. Introducing first.<br>
<br>
[“Art and Life” by Twista plays over the sound system of the arena and Shinya Okubo steps into view of the masses. He wears his wrestling gear and a white ICW t-shirt.]<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: From Shizouka, Japan and weighing in at 192 pounds, SHINYA OKUBO!!<br>
<br>
[Okubo walks slowly towards the ring, limping slightly as he gently touches outstretched hands. He climbs the ring steps, swipes his boots, and enters through the middle rope. Shinya steps to a turnbuckle and raises his right fist, saluting the crowd. He steps off of the buckles and uses the top rope to stretch as he awaits the start of the match.]<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: And his opponent.<br>
<br>
[The guitar opens up with “Burn it to the Ground.” When Chad Kroeger starts to sing, John Patrick walks out onto the stage. He stands there for a minute as five pyro blasts in gold go off on each side of him.]<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: From Wichita, Kansas weighing in at 240 pounds. "THE LEGEND BY DESIGN," JOHN PATRICK!!<br>
<br>
[Patrick then walks down the ramp and rolls under the bottom rope into the ring. He hits all for turnbuckles for poses.]<br>
<br>
<font color="red">***During this match there were audio difficulties, so there will be no commentary***<br></font>
<br>
[Bobby McGee is once again the official that gets the call for officiating duties. He gives both men instructions then signals for the bell.]<br>
<br>
[Collar and elbow tie-up by both men, with Patrick using his weight to full advantage to push Okubo back against the ropes. McGee calls for a clean break and seems to be getting just that when Patrick slaps Okubo across the face. The slap lights a fire into the eyes of Okubo as McGee admonishes Patrick.]<br>
<br>
[Okubo answers with a slap of his own, Patrick falls back on his ass and looks up at Okubo with wide eyes while holding his left hand against the left side of his face. Okubo crouches, motioning for Patrick to get to his feet.]<br>
<br>
[Patrick rises to his feet then looks to McGee, expressing concern that the Okubo hasn't been disqualified for using dirty tactics.]<br>
<br>
[Patrick and Okubo tie up once more. Patrick shoves Okubo back against the ropes once again. Patrick takes a swing but Okubo ducks beneath it. Patrick's momentum forces him against the ropes, Okubo spins him around then connects with a hard knife-edge chop that forces Patrick to wince with a vengeance. Okubo whips Patrick across the ring then charges, catching Patrick with a spinning heel kick. Patrick goes down hard, Okubo presses the attack, pulling Patrick up to his knees then attempts to catch him with a roundhouse kick. Patrick has it scouted, though and ducks beneath it. Thanks to Okubo's back being to him, Patrick is able to catch him with a waistlock from behind, pop his own hips then drive Okubo's back into the mat with a released German suplex.]<br>
<br>
[Patrick quickly goes on the offensive, grabbing Okubo's left leg then yanking hard on it a trio of times before placing his right foot where the thigh and waist connect then dropping to the right side for a hamstring pull. Okubo sits up, wincing in pain, only to get a dropkick to the back of the head from Patrick. Patrick quickly rises to his feet then grabs Okubo's leg, spinning him over so that he's lying face-down on the mat. Patrick lifts the lighter Okubo in the air by the left leg then slams the knee hard against the mat.<br>
<br>
[Okubo attempts to grab his leg, but Patrick lifts him in the air once more before driving the knee into the mat a second time.]<br>
<br>
[Patrick steps over Okubo's leg with his own right leg then drops to the mat, his left leg trapping Okubo's in a way that it isn't meant to be bent. Patrick applies a crossface, completing the application of the STF.]<br>
<br>
[McGee is down on one knee in front of Okubo, asking him if he wishes to submit. Okubo waves him off, Patrick cinches in the crossface even harder, yelling for Okubo to tap. Okubo refuses, reaching toward the ropes. Some members of the crowd are firmly behind him as his face turns a deeper shade of red. McGee continues to ask him if he wishes to submit, but he continues to wave him off.]<br>
<br>
[Patrick, frustrated that Okubo won't submit, releases the STF, only to get up then stomp on the back of Okubo's head. Patrick lifts Okubo up onto his feet then whips him hard into the farthest corner before charging. Okubo manages to stall his own momentum by grabbing the top rope, then pushes up off the mat just as Patrick arrives for a shoulder barge. Patrick was able to see what Okubo had done, narrowly missing making contact with the corner post with his shoulder. Okubo spins his lower body around then applies a body scissors while turning his upper body to face the ring. He tucks his upper body under then rolls, his momentum and weight forcing Patrick to roll backward out of the corner and into a pinning predicament. McGee quickly slides into position.]<br>
<br>
1.!<br>
<br>
2.!<br>
<br>
[Patrick escapes by quickly slapping his legs together around Okubo's head, effectively ringing his bell.]<br>
<br>
[Patrick is the first to get to his feet and it's obvious by the expression on his face that he's not happy with what almost transpired. Okubo is slow to get to his feet. Patrick stalks him; as soon as Okubo stands, Patrick catches him with a chop block to the left leg.]<br>
<br>
[Okubo writhes in pain, clutching his leg. Patrick quickly grabs the leg then yanks on it before pulling Okubo toward the ropes. Patrick drops to the mat then rolls out of the ring before grabbing Okubo's leg once more then pulling him so that his legs drape over the ring apron. Patrick slams the left leg repeatedly against the ring apron, doing further damage to the back of Okubo's knee.]<br>
<br>
[McGee begins a mandatory five count as Patrick slams the knee one more time against the ring apron. McGree admonishes Patrick as he rolls back into the ring and some members of the crowd begin to boo him. Patrick bends over to grab Okubo's leg, Okubo manages to grab his head then catch him with a small package. McGee immediately drops into position.]<br>
<br>
1.!<br>
<br>
2.!<br>
<br>
[Patrick escapes from the small package, a shocked expression on his face. He quickly rises to his feet then begins stomping away at Okubo. Patrick pulls Okubo off the mat then backs him against the ropes. Patrick whips Okubo across the ring then charges; Okubo makes an adjustment, leaping in the air, his feet landing on the middle rope. Okubo uses the middle rope as a springboard, twisting his body in the air for a cross body block. Patrick has the move scouted and drops, forcing Okubo to miss. Okubo rolls on the mat toward the opposite side of the ring while Patrick stands. As more of the crowd gets behind Okubo, Patrick, a frown on his face, stalks Okubo.]<br>
<br>
[Patrick pulls Okubo up so that they're facing. He quickly places Okubo's right arm behind his own head while placing his own right arm across Okubo's chest. Patrick kicks forward with his right leg then backward, hooking Okubo's right leg with it. At the same time, Patrick pulls his own upper body backward before snapping forward. The combination of the movements forces Okubo backward, the back of his head snapping against the mat, thanks to KtFO (STO).]<br>
<br>
[Instead of going for the cover, Patrick applies the Sharpshooter. He has it cinched in with a vengeance, riding back on Okubo to the point where he's nearly sitting on Okubo's back. Okubo is quick to tap, his hand furiously slapping against the mat. McGee calls for the ringing of the bell.]<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of this match. JOHN PATRICK!!<br>
<br>
[McGee raises Patrick's arm in the air as "Burn It to the Ground" begins to blare over the PA system. Patrick glares down at the fallen Okubo, shaking his head.]<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<font color="blue">Leslie Case-Inman couldn't be happier to have her debut match this evening. Though the butterflies are starting to swarm in her stomach, she does what she can to remain focus as she stretches in her locker room. Her husband, Robbie, and their five-year-old daughter, Ophelia, are sitting on the floor coloring in one of Ophelia's jumbo coloring books. Leslie has just finished stretching her back in the split position. She rises up from the floor and wipes the slight dampness of sweat from her forehead. She picks up a small water bottle and polishes off the last drop.<br>
<br>
Les: I'm gonna go get another water. You two okay here?<br>
<br>
Robbie looks up and smiles at his wife. On the surface, things seem to have gotten a slight bit better in the Inman household. Leslie and Robbie have definitely been a little friendlier toward each other and fighting less now that she's not trapped in a menial waitressing job.<br>
<br>
Robbie: I'll go get it, babe.<br>
<br>
She seems surprised.<br>
<br>
Les: You sure?<br>
<br>
Robbie stands up as Ophelia just continues coloring.<br>
<br>
Robbie: Sure. You stay here and keep getting yourself ready. I'll be right back.<br>
<br>
Leslie watches him as he leaves. It seems like it's been a while since he's offered to do something for her.<br>
<br>
Once he leaves the room, a grin crosses Robbie's face as he heads toward the right and down the hall. He seems to know where he's going as he comes upon another locker room door. He smiles as he knocks on the door, which is quickly opened by Kesley Case, Leslie's twin sister. When she see's he's come alone to see her, she pulls him into the room, kissing him hard. He wraps his arms around her waist.<br>
<br>
Robbie: We have to be quick. She thinks I'm just getting her some water.<br>
<br>
The door slams shut.<br>
<br></font>
*****<br>
<br>
[[A deep, harmonic organ starts to play over the PA as lyrics start to play. The lights fall deeper into black as the lyrics get further along.<br>
“They'll laugh as they watch us fall,<br>
The lucky don't care at all,<br>
No chance for fate,<br>
It's unnatural selection,<br>
I want the truth”<br>
A heavy riff starts as Samuel Hessingstock makes his way out of the curtain. Sam stares out to the crowd, wearing his custom hooded jacket, some spotlights shining green across the arena, creating slight fly-away light, as the crowd ROARS in cheer, chanting “SAM! SAM! SAM!” At this point he LAUNCHES himself down the ring in a full on sprint. The crowd go wild as Sam waits, lingering a little on the mat before springing up to his feet. A green spotlight follows Sydney down to the ring as she walks down, the lyrics “Dedication to a new age, Is this the end of destruction and rampage? Another chance to erase it then repeat it again.” playing.<br>
The song goes quieter, “Counterbalance this commotion.” plays as Sam turns, taunting out to the crowd with a large smile on his face. The song starts to pick up and Sam notices, turning and using the speed of the song to sprint up, and jumping onto the turnbuckle. He THROWS his arms out to the crowd before lifting the hood up on the jacket and flicking it backwards. He looks out to the crowd, pulling the “gun” symbol with his arms, his arms in a ‘quarter past nine’ position. He raises his arms slowly and pulls them up towards his face before “firing” the “guns” out towards the crowd before he rips the jacket from himself and throws it to the floor, turning and jumping off the turnbuckle. He stands on the mat for a second, before throwing his arms out again, capturing the crowds roar of cheers for him.]]<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: Ladies and gentlemen, this match is scheduled for one fall! Making his way to the ring, weighing in and at a trim 212 lbs., he stands at 6ft 1in tall, hailing from Oxford, England! I give you, The Scorpion, Samuel HESSINGSTOCK!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: This guy is just impressive! He brings so much charisma and talent into the match! Scotty Paine just isn’t quite going to measure up in my opinion!<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: I don’t personally think you can take anything away from either man! Both of them are tremendous athletes!<br>
<br>
*”Here Comes the Pain” by Slayer rips out of the PA, as Scotty Paine walks out onto the stage pushing a shopping cart full of hardcore goodies*<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: Making his way to the ring. From The Asylum, weighing in at Two-Hundred Forty-Five pounds. Here is Scotty “The Crow“ Paine!<br>
<br>
“Here Comes The Pain<br>
I am the new hell on earth<br>
The lord of agony divine<br>
Domination, intimidation<br>
Lives within these eyes<br>
Reign of power<br>
Remorseless anarchy<br>
I am arrogance in the flesh<br>
Unleashed intensity”<br>
<br>
*He stops at the top of the ramp, and strikes a cross-like pose. He then continues down the ramp, and makes his way to the ring*<br>
<br>
“Step aside for the nightmare<br>
Pure destruction stands before you<br>
No escape as the psycho<br>
Brings you misery<br>
The line starts here<br>
<br>
I am brutality the face of everlasting pain<br>
Annihilation, Obliteration<br>
Pulses in these veins<br>
Sheer defiance drives my hostility<br>
I am merciless to the core<br>
Chaotic fury breeds “<br>
<br>
*He pushes the cart up to the side of the ring, and rolls in under the ropes. He pops up to his feet, and flips off his opponent*<br>
<br>
“Step aside for the nightmare<br>
Pure destruction stands before you<br>
No escape as the psycho<br>
Brings you misery<br>
The line starts here<br>
<br>
Bring it all on<br>
Come and take on what you fear<br>
I'm the storm<br>
That towers overhead<br>
Ticking time bomb<br>
With an infinite charge<br>
Bringer of torture<br>
The master is here<br>
Everyone falls”<br>
<br>
*He rushes over, climbs up to the second turnbuckle, and crosses his arms in an X fashion. He yells out "I am the meaning of Xtreme!"*<br>
<br>
“Here comes the pain<br>
You're no different from the rest<br>
Victim is your name in my vicious wasteland<br>
Here comes the pain<br>
Your destruction manifests<br>
Lying there broken looking up as I still stand<br>
<br>
Bring it all on<br>
Come and take on what you fear<br>
I'm the storm<br>
That towers overhead<br>
Ticking time bomb<br>
With an infinite charge<br>
Bringer of torture<br>
The master is here<br>
Everyone falls!”<br>
<br>
*Scotty hopes down, and turns to face his opponent, as the bell rings*<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: I can feel the intensity now! Scotty looks ready for a fight!<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: Hess is clearly the better man here! I think you should get your eyes checked!<br>
<br>
*Scotty initiates a grapple on Hess, he is clearly the larger of the two men and shows it as he shoves Hessingstock to the ground. A smirk comes across the face of Hess as he gets back to his feet. He motions for Scotty to lock up again. Scotty rushes him and over powers him once more sending him crashing back to the mat! Hess still sports the grin as he comes back to his feet.*<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: Scotty can bully him all day long and Hess is just going to get right back in his face!<br>
<br>
*Scotty has surely made a statement that he is trying to establish dominance in this match up. He goes in to lock up with Hess once more but Hess is quickly on the offense this time. He delivers a boot to the gut of Scotty Paine and immediately follows up up with a fist to the side of Scotty’s head dropping him to one knee! Hess darts into the ropes and delivers a high knee to the skull of Scotty Paine that sends him crashing to the mat! Hess is quick to capitalize and quickly locks in a modified version of a crossface. He wrenches on Scotty’s neck!*<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: Scotty may have no choice but to tap out of this move! Hessingstock has him in near perfect ring positioning!<br>
<br>
*Scotty amazingly starts to shift his weight towards the ring ropes. He manages to crawl and squirm until he is able to lock his hand around the bottom rope! Hess has no choice but to break the hold. Scotty slide out of the ring! He has a sadistic smile come across his face. The ref starts in on the mandatory ten count.*<br>
<br>
Scotty Paine: IS THAT THE BEST YOU GOT HESS? YOU’RE NOTHING!<br>

He is quick on the follow up and connects with an inverted DDT. He is quick to cover. The ref starts the count………<br>
<br>
ONE………<br>
<br>

<br>
THR………Hessingstock is able to get the shoulder up! Scotty looks at the ref with a visibly upset look on his face. He’s done playing games with Hessingstock. He stands up and aggressively delivers a few stomps to the sternum of Sam Hessingstock! He looks at the ref and quickly flips him off!*<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: Disqualify him ref! That was uncalled for!<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: I think that is the first time I have agreed with you during this match!<br>
<br>
*Scotty heads to the top rope which is a bit unusual for him. He points out to the crowd and makes a few gestures to get the going. He them comes off with a swan dive headbutt! Hessingstock amazingly rolls out of the way causing Scotty to meet nothing more than the madding of the ring! Hess quick to capitalize rolls over onto the fallen Scotty Paine. The ref starts the count…………………<br>

TWO……<br>
<br>
THRE……………Scotty Paine slides his foot on top of the bottom ring rope! The ref breaks the count! Hess looks at it and then quickly hooks the leg and goes for another cover!*<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: Hess is wasting no time at all! I respect that! It’s over here hands down!<br>
<br>
*The ref counts……<br>
<br>
ONE………<br>
<br>
TWO……KICKOUT by Scotty Paine! He ducks out of the ring and falls to his knees. He fumbles around and our cameras catch a glimpse of what appears to be brass knucks! Scotty quickly slides the knucks on his hand and slide back into the ring before the ref has even started the count. Once Hess realizes that Scotty is back in the ring, he rushes Scotty and gets clocked in the side of the head with the brass knucks! Hess is knocked out cold and crashes down to the mat! Scotty quickly slides the knucks into his shorts before the ref ever sees them!*<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: That was a blatant DQ! He just hit Hess with a pair of brass knuckles!<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: I didn’t see anything! That was just a solid hook on the part of Scotty Paine! He should have been a boxer with moves like that!<br>
<br>
*Scotty capitalizes on the down Samuel Hessingstock. He rolls him up into a cover. The ref counts one more time…<br>
<br>
ONE…<br>
<br>
TWO……<br>
<br>
THREE……………Just before the ref’s hand could make contact for the three count Hess managed to get his shoulder up! He is bleeding from the shot from the brass knuckles. Scotty looks over at him in disbelief! He drives his own knuckles into his forehead causing the wound to open even more! Scotty pulls Hess to his feet, Hess is visibly weakened and nearly collapses. Scotty whips him into the ropes and is surprised when Hess come back across with a cross body that lands him in a cover from Hess! The ref makes the count once more…<br>
<br>
ONE……<br>
<br>
TWO…<br>
<br>
THRE………………Scotty gets his shoulder up!*<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: I don’t know how either of these men are able to keep going! Scotty Paine pulling out everything he has, Samuel Hessingstock pulling out all the stops as well! This match right here was definitely worth the gate price!<br>
<br>
*Hess pulls Scotty out into the middle of the ring! He makes the climb to the top turn buckle and then comes off with “The Original Sin”! He goes into another cover on Scotty Paine! The ref counts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
ONE…………<br>
<br>

THREE!<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: Ladies and gentlemen, here is your winner, Samuel Hessingstock!!!<br>
<br>
Summer: What an impressive victory by Samuel Hessingstock!<br>
<br>
Johnny: I knew there was a reason I signed this kid. He is definitely going to go places in ICW.<br>
<br>
Summer: Well, we will see how he does in the tournament at Eve of Destruction.<br>
<br>
Johnny: That we will Summer, that we will.<br>

<br>
<font color="blue">Back in Leslie Case-Inman's locker room, she now sits alone with her daughter who has gotten out some of her Barbie dolls and talked her mother into sitting and playing with her for a little bit before she has to go to work. With a quizzical look in her eyes, Ophelia sets her doll down and looks up to her mother.<br>
<br>
Ophi: Mommy, are you gonna be on TV tonight?<br>
<br>
Leslie smiles at her and runs her finger across Ophi's forehead, getting some hair out of her face.<br>
<br>
Les: Yeah, baby, I am.<br>
<br>
The little girls eyes light up.<br>
<br>
Ophi: Am I gonna be on TV tonight?<br>
<br>
She can't help but laugh.<br>
<br>
Les: There's a good chance that you'll be on TV tonight, too.<br>
<br>
Ophi: Oh, man! Everyone at school's gonna be so jealous when I tell them that my mommy and me are on TV, now!<br>
<br>
Ophelia picks up her Barbie doll in one hand and a Ken doll in the other and reenacts her telling her school mates about her weekend on TV. Leslie smiles as she looks up at the clock. It's been about 15 minutes since Robbie left to get her a water. Did he get lost or something? As she tries to shrug it off, there is a knock at her door.<br>
<br>
Les: Yeah?<br>
<br>
ICW's Road Agent, Jonathan Black, pops his shaved head into the door.<br>
<br>
Jonathan: Your match is coming up soon.<br>
<br>
Les: Thanks.<br>
<br>
With a handsome smile, Mr. Black leaves the room. Leslie had asked for a warning call when her match was getting close. When her daughter's on the road with her, she'd rather her not see the show until Leslie can be sure nothing happened that her young, impressionable eyes shouldn't see.<br>
<br>
Les: Well, let's go find your daddy.<br>
<br>
Leslie's anxiety rises as she stands up and grabs Ophelia's hand. She follows her mother, bringing her Barbie doll with her. They head toward the catering area where Robbie would have to go to get her water. As they round the corner, Leslie collides with Robbie who drops the water bottle and is quick to grab a hold of her so she doesn't fall. He chuckles a little as she catches her breath.<br>
<br>
Robbie: You alright?<br>
<br>
Les: Yeah. They just came to let me know my match is coming up. What took you so long?<br>
<br>
As Robbie kneels down to pick up the water, he looks back into the catering room and sees interviewer "Slick" Rick Carson standing at the food table.<br>
<br>
Robbie: Oh, I just got caught up in talking with Slick Rick. Sorry.<br>
<br>
He hands her the water bottle.<br>
<br>
Les: Thanks. You gonna watch?<br>
<br>
Robbie leans in and gives his wife a quick kiss.<br>
<br>
Robbie: Yeah.<br>
<br>
Ophelia jumps up and Robbie picks her up, holding her on his right hip.<br>
<br>
Ophi: Me, too.<br>
<br>
Leslie gives Robbie a look of concern. She's a little unsure if Ophi should watch just in case Leslie gets hurt. Robbie gives her a reassuring grin.<br>
<br>
Robbie: Don't worry, babe. I'll distract her if anything happens. She wants to see her mother in action.<br>
<br>
Leslie sighs and nods.<br>
<br>
Les: Alright, I gotta go. Wish me luck.<br>
<br>
She rises on her tip toes, giving him a kiss that takes him a bit by surprise. She lingers on his lips for a moment and he can't help but bring his free hand to her face, kissing her back before their lips part. She kisses Ophelia on the cheek and turns to walk toward the ready area.<br>
<br>
Ophi: Good luck, mommy!<br>
<br>
Robbie just watches her as she goes, a horribly confused, guilty feeling washing over him.<br>

<br>
Terry pulls Leslie to her feet. He attempts the Irish Whip, but Leslie reverses, which sends him into the ropes. Leslie charges in with a clothesline, sending Terry over the top rope and onto the floor. Referee Don Davidson begins the count.<br>

<br>
Johnny: No matter who wins, the fans have got their money’s worth out of this match.<br>
<br>
Leslie is outside the ring. As she goes to pull Terry to his feet, he shoves her away. Terry grabs Leslie and whips her into the steel ring steps before sliding back in the ring.<br>

Don Davidson check to see if he submits. Terry screams, “NO!”<br>
<br>
Summer: Terry is in trouble if he can't break that hold.<br>

<font color="blue">(The camera begins to roll. We open inside someone’s dressing room. The camera pans around to find Annabelle Jones is propped up against the wall. A cocky smirk is etched across her face as she stares into the camera.)<br>
<br>
Annabelle: I think it is painfully clear to each and every one of you in attendance that tonight’s card features a huge mismatch in the form of yours truly, ICW’s greatest second generation superstar, against that idiot who doesn’t measure up to me in any way, Alex Morgan.<br>
<br>
(Annabelle throws her head back and laughs.)<br>
<br>
Annabelle: Why must I face the same, pathetic level of competition week in and week out? Is it the fact that the ICW brass is afraid of me? Are they afraid of who I am and what I will inevitably become?<br>
<br>
(Annabelle nods her head.)<br>
<br>
Annabelle: I think I just hit the nail right on the head. LJ and Trinity, they know….when they look at me, when they look into my eyes…….they know that they are looking into the future of ICW. And I don’t speak this because I am arrogant or egotistical. That’s my mother. She is the arrogant and egotistical one. I never let my ego get in the way. I always speak fact. The FACT of the matter is that it is my destiny to become the best in the world! I can’t help that I am as good as I say I am.<br>
<br>
So LJ, Trin, when you watch my match tonight against Alex Morgan, I want you both to pay close attention to what I do. Pay close attention to the way I completely and utterly dominate this low class buffoon and prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that he isn’t worthy of being in the same ring as me. And then, after I’ve knocked down another one of your pathetic excuses of an obstacle in my path towards superstardom, maybe then you will kindly give me some good competition.<br>
<br>
(Annabelle shrugs her shoulders.)<br>
<br>
Annabelle: But then again, is there really any good competition left? I mean, in this business you have me and then you have……everyone else. I am in a class all on my own. No one can touch me, least of all some overgrown Neanderthal named Alex Morgan.<br>
<br>
Change is upon us, ladies and gentlemen. A new age is about to dawn, an age marked by the reign of a new Queen….Annabelle Jones, the NEW Queen of Professional Wrestling, and believe me when I say that the Queen is ready to ascend to her rightful throne here in ICW. I don’t need my overbearing mother, I don’t need the masses of unwashed leeches called fans, or anyone else for that matter, because being the best, being the Queen, it is my destiny.<br>

Jimmy Landell, Jr.: The following contest is set for one fall. Introducing first, from Peoria, Illinois standing five feet, seven inches and weighing 145 lbs, Kelsey Case!!!<br>
<br>
("You're Going Down" by Sick Puppies plays as Kelsey makes her way to the ring.)<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: And her opponent from Phoenix, Arizona standing five feet, eleven inches and weighing 234 lbs., "The Viper" Ransom Rochelle!!!<br>
<br>
The lights go out and "The Undertaker” by Puscifer begins to play on the PA sound system as “The Viper” Ransom Rochelle begins to walk out from behind the curtains. He stands in front of the entrance way as he examines the crowd with disgust and contempt.<br>
<br>
Ransom charges in, wrapping his arms around Kelsey's neck. He locks in a headlock before running forward and dropping Kelsey to the mat with a Running Bulldog. Ransom lifts Kelsey on to his shoulders, spinning around with an Airplane Spin before dropping her to the mat once more. Kelsey grabs the ropes and slowly pulls herself to her feet. Ransom grabs a handful of her hair, but Kelsey brings a series of elbows to the gut of Ransom, sending him backwards. Ransom charges in with a clothesline, which Kelsey dodges. Ransom turns to meet a Super Kick to the face from Kelsey.<br>
<br>
Summer: Ransom has been dominating this match. Kelsey was able to turn things around with that Super Kick, however.<br>
<br>
Johnny: Kelsey will have to use her speed and agility to offset Ransom's size and strength.<br>
<br>
Kelsey waits for Ransom to stand up before she hits the Twist of Fate. She then climbs up the corner turnbuckles and flies off with a Frog Splash. Kelsey hooks the leg, making the cover as referee Jason Burns makes the count.<br>
<br>
1.<br>
2. No! Ransom powers out and tosses Kelsey across the ring.<br>
<br>
Summer: Ransom tossed Kelsey off as if she were a rag doll.<br>
<br>
Johnny: Ransom does have the power advantage, but it would be foolish to underestimate Kelsey Case.<br>
<br>
Ransom grabs onto Kelsey. Standing behind her, he lifts her up hitting a Belly to Back Brainbuster Suplex. Ransom starts to lay into her with a series of stomps to the gut and chest area before lifting her up over his head, holding her there before dropping her behind him. Ransom drags her to her feet. Firmly gripping her around the head and neck, Ransom delivers a short arm DDT, rolls her over and hooks the leg.<br>
<br>
1.<br>
2.<br>
3. No! Kelsey rolls the shoulder up!<br>
<br>
Johnny: I was sure he had her there.<br>
<br>
Summer: Kelsey is not going down that easy. Not after her loss to Annabelle Jones two weeks ago.<br>
<br>
Ransom pulls Kelsey up by her right arm, locking in an arm lock. Ransom tightens the hold as Kelsey grimaces in pain before she is finally able to break the hold by executing a flip. She follows up with a drop toehold, taking him down. Ransom is to his feet and Kelsey leaps up, executing a Hurricane and driving him hard to the mat. She makes sure to hook the leg before Jason Burns makes the count.<br>
<br>
1.<br>
2.<br>
3. No! Ransom kicks out!<br>
<br>
Summer: Kelsey moves a lot like her twin sister, Leslie.<br>
<br>
Johnny: And we saw how Leslie's début turned out earlier tonight.<br>
<br>
Both wrestlers are to their feet. Ransom lands an Irish Whip that sends Kelsey into the corner. He charges in with a Flying Splash. He, again, lifts Kelsey off the mat and places her in the corner. He starts to lay into her with a series of rights as the crowd counts along with referee Jason Burns.<br>

7.<br>
8.<br>
9.<br>
10.<br>
<br>
Ransom moves back, allowing Kelsey to fall face forward to the mat.<br>
<br>
Summer: Ransom is a beast. There is no excuse to use the ten count on a much smaller Kelsey Case.<br>
<br>
Johnny: When you step into that ring, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes to win. If Kelsey does not understand that, she is in the wrong sport.<br>
<br>
Ransom lifts Kelsey up onto the top turnbuckle then climbs up, hooking her tights as he prepares to lift her for a Suplex. Kelsey blocks and the two jockey for position. Kelsey, in an amazing feat of strength, drops Ransom to the mat with a Suplex that leaves both wrestlers out on the mat.<br>
<br>
Summer: What a move by Kelsey Case! I have no idea how she pulled that off!<br>
<br>
Johnny: Pure adrenaline is what that was, but now neither wrestler is moving.<br>
<br>
In the ring, Jason Burns begins the mandatory ten count.<br>

1.<br>

Ransom slowly makes his way to his feet.<br>

Kelsey also rises to her feet, but Ransom seems to be distracted by someone outside the ring.<br>
<br>
Johnny: It's Angel! What is she doing here and where is her monster, Syn?<br>
<br>
Summer: Those are good questions, Johnny.<br>
<br>
Referee Jason Burns goes to the ropes and orders Angel to vacate the ringside area. Ransom, enraged, goes to the ropes and viciously snarls at the young girl. As Ransom is distracted, Kelsey comes behind Ransom and rolls him up for the pin as Jason Burns hits the mat starts the count.<br>
<br>
1.<br>
2.<br>
3.<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell, Jr.: Ladies and gentlemen, the winner, Kelsey Case!!!<br>
<br>
Summer: That distraction by Angel cost Ransom the match.<br>
<br>
Johnny: I think that was her intention.<br>
<br>
Summer: Whatever the case, Kelsey Case has scored a pin fall victory and built momentum going into Eve of Destruction.<br>
<br>
Johnny: That is true. It has been a good night for the Case sisters. They have a reason to celebrate this holiday season.<br>
<br>
As Ransom fumes in the ring, Angel backs slowly up the ramp with a smirk plastered on her face.<br>

<br>
*“Just Close Your Eyes” by Waterproof Blonde begins to play over the loudspeakers of the arena. The tron flashes to life and we see scenes of Marie Annabelle Jones in action against various opponents. The words “The Next Generation” appear on the tron. Then a spotlight shines on the stage and Annabelle herself steps out onto the ramp with an ear to ear grin on her face and dressed in her wrestling gear that consists of black pants, a black top, and black boots. Her long red hair hangs down to shoulder length. Based on the confident stride with which the young lady makes her way to the ring, it is obvious that she is ready for action. Annabelle steps up onto the ring steps and up onto the apron. She steps inside the ring and waits patiently for the match to begin.*<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: I’ve never seen someone look more ready for a match in my life! She looks absolutely pumped!<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: She does look ready! She is really showing signs of her mother every time I see this girl!<br>
<br>
*Notorious Ecstasy hits the PA and the Outlaw himself appears on the entrance ramp, spreading his arms and simply basking in the moment. He eventually marches briskly down the ramp and leaps onto the apron, raising an arm before he leaps over the third rope. He climbs the turnbuckle and raises his arms, pausing only to run a hand through his hair. He jumps down and pulls down on the ropes, stretching up for the match. Jimmy Landell, Jr. takes his spot in the ring with his microphone in hand.*<br>
<br>
Jimmy Landell Jr: Ladies and gentlemen it is time for the main event of the evening! On my left, hailing from Boston Massachusetts, standing at a petite five feet, seven inches and weighing at a slender one hundred thirty pounds, she is Annabelle Jones!!! On my right, hailing the Bronx in New York, he stands at six foot one inches tall, weighing in at a trim two hundred twenty three pounds, THE OUTLAW, Alex MORGAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
*Morgan and Jones shake hands and the bell sounds as Jimmy Landell exits the ring. Morgan is quick to lock up with Jones and easily out powers her. He forces her back into the corner and the ref steps between them to break the hold. Morgan releases the hold and quickly delivers an open handed slap to the face of Annabelle Jones!*<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: What a cheap shot from the Outlaw, Alex Morgan!<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: Sometimes you have to pull all the stops!<br>
<br>
*The ref warns Morgan about the cheap shot and he simply brushes it off. Annabelle comes out of the corner and Morgan catches her with a quick arm drag that sends her crashing to the mat! Jones is visibly starting to get frustrated because of not being able to gain momentum against the larger athlete! She pounds her fist against the mat. She hops up to her feet and as Morgan approaches her she takes him down with a drop toe hold!*<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: That was cheap! DQ her ref! He wasn’t even paying attention!<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: Coming from the guy who seconds ago said that sometimes you have to pull out all the stops!<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: Oh save it! Alex Morgan is pure talent, he doesn’t deserve to be treated like that!<br>
<br>
*Jones follows up the offence and can hooks him in a head scissors! She shows tremendous leg strength as Morgan’s face visible changes to a beat red! The ref checks the hold and checks in to see if Morgan wants to give up! Morgan screams out in agony and slowly scoots his body towards the ring ropes! He uses every bit of his strength and slowly makes it to the bottom rope and manages to drape his foot over. Jones breaks the hold and hops to her feet and descends the ring ropes and perches herself on the top turnbuckle! Alex Morgan slowly comes to his feet and Jones comes off with a cross body but Morgan catches her and slams her ribs down into his knee. He rolls her off his leg and then goes for a cover. Senior official Bobby McGee slides into position to make the cover……<br>
<br>
One…<br>
<br>
Two…<br>
<br>
……………Jones gets her shoulder up. Morgan gets in the face of McGee and argues that he made a slow count. He pounds his hand against the other motioning that it was a three count. This allows time for Annabelle to roll him up into a small package and Bobby McGee slides in for a count once again!<br>
<br>
One…<br>
<br>
Two…<br>
<br>
Thr……As Bobby’s hand was coming down Alex Morgan was able to power out of the pin attempt!*<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: I knew Alex Morgan still had some gas left in the tank! Little orphan Annie is going to have to do a bit better than that if she wants to put this one in the books!<br>
<br>
*Alex Morgan pulls Annabelle’s legs out from under her causing her to drape her neck across the bottom ring rope. Morgan gets a deranged look in his eye and hops up to his feet. He stalks over to the rope hung Annabelle and places his right foot down on the back of her head and applies pressure to her neck and throat! Bobby McGee starts the five count.<br>
<br>
One…<br>
<br>
Two…<br>
<br>
Three…<br>
<br>
Four……<br>
<br>
Morgan breaks the hold and then looks at the Ref.*<br>
<br>
Alex Morgan: Shut up Ref, I got till five!<br>
<br>
Johnny Sorrow: Tell him how it is Alex! Put that senile old man in his place!<br>
<br>
*Morgan rolls Jones over leaving her neck against the bottom rope. He hooks her legs for a slingshot and then drops all his weight causing Annabelle’s head to snap off the middle ring rope. Morgan pulls her away from the ropes and goes for the pin…..<br>
<br>
One…<br>
<br>

Thre………Annabelle shows us just how much heart she has and is able to get her shoulder up. Alex Morgan is frustrated, he’s tried nearly everything to put this match away but this girl is tough! He stands up and walks towards the corner. He removes the top cover from the turnbuckle and tosses it to the ground. He walks back over and pulls Annabelle to her feet and tries to whip her into the corner but she reverses it and send him face first into the exposed metal!*<br>
<br>
Summer Breeze: That was the shift of momentum that Annabelle needed! She could have it here!<br>
<br>
*Annabelle pulls the bigger competitor to his feet and hits her Vindicator! She goes for the pin!!!<br>
